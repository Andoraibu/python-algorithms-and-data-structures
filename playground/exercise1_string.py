# Time to review all the basic data types we learned! This should be a

## Problem 1 ##

# Given the string:
s = 'flask'

# Use indexing to print out the following:
# 'f'

# 's'

# 'ask'

# 'las'

# 'k'

# Bonus: Use indexing to reverse the string
print(s[0])
print(s[3])
print(s[2:])
print(s[1:4])
print(s[-1])
print(s[::-1])

# You are given two variables:
age = 4
name = "Sammy"

# Use print formatting to print the following string:
# "Hello my dog's name is Sammy and he is 4 years old"
print("Hello my dog's name is {} and he is {} years old".format(name, age))
